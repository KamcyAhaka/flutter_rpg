# flutter_rpg

A Role-Playing Game character builder designed by [TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/thenetninja). Adapted and extended by me Divine "KamCy" Ahaka.

## About Project

This project was originally designed and developed by TheNetNinja as part of his Futter Masterclass. I simply chose to add more functionalities to the app to test my knowledge of Flutter.

These functionalities include but are not limited to

- Added Firebase Authentication

- Implemented conditional shell routing using GoRouter

- Added full authentication workflows and implemented protected routes

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
